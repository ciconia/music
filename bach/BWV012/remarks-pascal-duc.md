Remarks
-------

- sources:
  - V remove sources from title page, put in preface.
  - V describe sources - size, number of pages, paper type.
  - V indicate which is the principal source.
  - V add critical notes - what was corrected/added/chosen. whatever is mentioned in the preface should be augmented and discussed further in the critical notes.
  - V for St 109 the different parts should be enumerated.
  - V the availability of sources online should be indicated, the address given, along with the date of consultation.

- preface:
  - V he's not certain that articulations are "not entirely consistent", but rather placed in an approximative manner. In his head Bach was consistent, but his hand wasn't so much.
  - V any arguments for incosnsistency or any choices should be made in the critical notes, rather than mentioning them in passing.

- transposition:
  - V he'd make two distinct versions (score and parts), one in f and one in g.
  - X *for the trumpet, a trumpettist should be consulted*.
  - V In any case, the remark about the trumpet should be expanded with a footnote including the Kuhnau quote (Haynes pp. 183, 260n70).
  
- graphics:
  - V score: too small
  - V staff lines to thick
  - V slurs too thick
  - V and sometimes too close to the notes (e.g. oboe m. 7 in the sinfonia).
  - V the figures are in general too close to the staff and too small.
  - / (Now with the bigger staff size it's ok to start on recto) he would start the sinfonia on the verso page so as to prevent a page turn.
  - V not enough space between staves. the minimum space is staff height.
  - V the lyrics too small to be comfortably read by singers.
  - V the slurs are badly placed when slurring two notes of opposite stem direction.
  - V text size: the titles are too big, the tempo indications too small. The different indications should conform to the following rules:
    - that they are placed where the eye is used to look for them
    - that their size be proportional to their importance. one has to look at a lot of well-made editions in order to get a good eye for sizes.
    
- en vrac:
  - V 2.coro tempo: Lente (et non Lento)
  - / (I explain in the critical notes why this is not the right thing to do) 2.coro - Bach uses a 6/2 mettre with small vertical separators in the middle of each bar, etc.
  - V 2.coro m. 89 alto - Zeichen and not Zei-chen.
  - V 3.recitativo - the music is too small and so everything is a bit stretched out.
  - / (4.aria - alto m. 11 - editorial alterations should be placed in smaller font size in front of the notes and not above them.
  - V 6.aria - tenore m. 21 - slur too close to text prolongation.
  - V 6.aria - tenore m. 37-39 - dash too high relative to letters.
  - V 6.aria - tenore m. 45 - not enough space between "gen" and "bl√ºht". Words should be spaced enough in order to facilitate reading the broken syllables.
  - V 7.choral - fermatas too close to the staff.
  
- parts:
  - V the instrument should be indicated at the top left corner of the first page.
  - V for the recitativo, should include the singer's part.
  - V for tacet movements, the lyrics should be included.
  - V try to avoid having most of the page blank.
  - V (avoid bad page turns)
