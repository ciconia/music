# Ciconia's Score Repository

This repository contains my edition of various Bach works (and hopefully more composers in the future) typeset using [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) and [Ripple](http://github.com/ciconia/ripple/tree).

## Processing the files

In order to view the scores and parts, the source files need to be converted into PDF files. In order to do that run ripple:

    ripple <work name>
    
To process BWV676 run the following:

    ripple BWV676
    
To process all pieces, run ripple without any arguments.

All PDF files are placed in the \_pdf\_ directory.
